# Groovy Goodness

The Groovy Goodness series is [a series of blog entries](http://mrhaki.blogspot.com) on Groovy features. And what better way to show a feature than with a code sample. In this repository the samples for the different blog entries are stored.

The directory `Blog/Posts` contains directories for each blog entry. The sample Groovy files are placed inside those directories.

The directory `OfflineSite` contains the articles from the blog as local HTML files. If we open the file `index.hmtl` we can start browsing through the blog posts.

# Author and Origin
