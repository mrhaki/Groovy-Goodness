It is very easy to create our own builder simply with closures. A node in the builder is simply a method and we can use a closure as the argument of the method to create a new level in the builder hierarchy.</p><p>We can use pre-defined method names in our builder syntax, but can also use dynamic or unkown method names by implementing the <code>methodMissing</code> method. The same goes for properties we can implement with real property methods or by implementing the <code>propertyMissing</code> method.</p><p>In our example we create a new builder to create a <code>Reservation</code> object for a travel flight. In the builder we can define a list of passengers, the destination airport, the departing airport and if the flight is a two-way flight.</p><pre class="brush:groovy">// Builder syntax to create a reservation with passengers,
// departing and destination airport and make it a 2-way flight.
def reservation = new ReservationBuilder().make {
    passengers {
        name 'mrhaki'
        name 'Hubert A. Klein Ikkink'
    }
    from 'Schiphol, Amsterdam'
    to 'Kastrup, Copenhagen'
    retourFlight
}

assert reservation.flight.from == new Airport(name: 'Schiphol', city: 'Amsterdam')
assert reservation.flight.to == new Airport(name: 'Kastrup', city: 'Copenhagen')
assert reservation.passengers.size() == 2
assert reservation.passengers == [new Person(name: 'mrhaki'), new Person(name: 'Hubert A. Klein Ikkink')]
